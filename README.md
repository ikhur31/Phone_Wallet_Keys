# Phone_Wallet_Keys
Initial Commit

PWK - Phone, Wallet, Keys is an app that is being developed by a small team to solve one common problem, forgetfulness. 
With everything going on in our everyday lives, sometimes the important things tend to be left behind and aren’t noticed 
until it's too late. That’s what PWK aims to solve.

The PWK application is designed to make keeping track of important items easier through the use of bluetooth technology. 
The application itself will track bluetooth frequencies and alert the user, through a notification, whichever frequency is
no longer in range.
